# Photopea Anti-Anti-Adblock
I'm of the opinion that when your application runs most or all of it's compute on the user's computer, that you don't get to then fully prevent the application from working due to adblockers. [This software works entirely offline.](https://github.com/suzuke/photopea) You do not get to control the software a user chooses to run on their own machine.

This is a simple Firefox extension that removes the anti-adblocker behavior from Photopea using patches.

This extension does not:
- Block ads (it removes the anti-adblocker behavior, but not the ads themselves)
- "Crack" the application (like enabling paid status)
- Disable telemetry
- Disable popups asking for donations (I still encourage you to donate to Photopea if you use it)
- Disable the donate button
